### A simple console program to calculate the Lack of Cohesion in Methods(LCOM) equation by Chidamber and Kemerer, made with C#.

My motivation is just to transform the paper equation to a programmatic one. The main equation at least is working with most simpler scenarios.

## Next steps:
### 1 - User input
Basic system for user input, asking how many attributes and methods a given class have and the number of each given attribute scattered on the methods.

### 2 -Class file scanning
Next I'll try to implement a mechanism of scanning a class file and letting an algorithm analyze the attributes and classes of it!
